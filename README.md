# Wireless-Power-Transmission-Using-Resonant-Coupling-and-Induction
This is the paper which me and my 4 friends published during our Bachelors. This was part of last semester project.

Somehow, the original link
https://www.ijert.org/view-pdf/6224/wireless-power-transmission-using-resonant-coupling-and-induction
directs us to IJERT's main site. So, we can't access the paper anymore.

Please use this for future reference.

Authors: Tanmay Tandon, Prasoon Dhaneswar, Mr. Abhishek Verma, Dr. Anup Mishra.
Three of my friends were also involved in this publication: Abhishek John Masih, Nishant Kumar Dewangan, and Saket Bhawar.
